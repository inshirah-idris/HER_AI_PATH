# HER_AI_PATH
HERAIPATH is a web app that aims to close the gender gap in AI and data science. It uses AI to tailor a career path for each user, and provides them with learning resources and community support. HERAIPATH helps women and girls in Africa to discover, learn, and pursue careers in AI and tech fields.


# Introduction
In the rapidly evolving digital age, the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and data science have emerged as key drivers of innovation and growth. However, a significant gender gap persists, with women, particularly in Africa, facing numerous barriers to entry and progression. This is the gap that HerAIPath aims to fill. HerAIPath is a platform designed to address this gap and empower African girls and women to access AI and data science careers.
HerAIPath is not just a platform; it embodies a community and a movement. We aim to bridge the gender gap in technology by providing resources, mentorship, and opportunities for African women to acquire and develop the skills and knowledge necessary for successful careers in the tech industry. "HerAIPath" aspires to empower a fresh generation of African women to not only engage in but also spearhead and innovate in these avant-garde fields.
Problem Statement
In recent years, the fields of AI and data science have seen exponential growth, significantly influencing various sectors globally. These fields offer immense potential for innovation, economic development, and societal advancement. However, this rapid growth has also highlighted a critical issue: the significant underrepresentation of women in those fields. A significant gender gap persists in AI and data science.
Some key findings from UNESCO reports reported that women are particularly underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and, consequently, in STEM careers1, and that just 22% of professionals working in the field of AI are women2. Kaggle reported that in the 2020 Machine Learning and Data Science survey3, there were 20,000 respondents; only 20% were women. 
These statistics underscore the significant gender gap in AI and data science globally. In Africa, this gap is even more pronounced. African women and girls face numerous barriers to entry and progression in these fields. These barriers range from a lack of access to quality education and resources to societal norms and biases that discourage women from pursuing careers in tech. The result is a predominantly male tech industry, with women underrepresented in both leadership and technical roles.


# Existing AI Career Guidance Tools
The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in various sectors, including education and career planning, has led to the development of AI career guidance tools. These tools are becoming increasingly vital for students and professionals navigating their career paths. They offer personalized advice, utilize real-time data, and provide assessments to assist in making informed decisions about the future. The following table give a summary of the top AI career guidance tools in the internet that have redefined career planning:
